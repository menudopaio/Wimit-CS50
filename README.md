<h4> Description: </h4>
A web application for setting and scheduling meetings with people we already know. Participants of an activity vote for their preferred place and time and the program then reveals the top choices, automatically scheduling the most popular options.
The goal of this project is to consolidate all the knowledge I have into a single space, all the while embracing and learning from the new challenges that arise, and have fun in the whole process!
